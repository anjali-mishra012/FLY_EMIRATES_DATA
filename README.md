# Fly Emirates Flight Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **Fly Emirates flight operations data** to identify patterns, delays, cancellations, and performance trends. The objective is to simulate a **real-world Data Analyst project**, covering end-to-end data handling — from raw data cleaning to insight generation and visualization.
This project was built as part of my **Data Analyst learning journey**, with an emphasis on practical analytics skills used in the industry.

## Objectives
* Analyze flight performance and operational efficiency
* Identify reasons for **flight delays and cancellations**
* Understand airline-wise and route-wise trends
* Perform structured **data cleaning and transformation**
* Create insights useful for operational and business decisions

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains flight-level information such as:
* Airline details (Fly Emirates)
* Origin and destination airports
* Scheduled and actual departure/arrival times
* Delay duration
* Cancellation indicators and reasons

Multiple datasets were used, including:
* Flights data
* Airlines reference data
* Airports reference data

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
* **SQL (PostgreSQL)** – Data cleaning, joins, transformations, aggregations
* **Microsoft Excel** – Initial data understanding and validation
* **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard creation and visualization
* **Python (optional / EDA)** – Exploratory analysis (if applicable)
* **GitHub** – Version control and project documentation

---

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
Key data preparation steps included:
* Handling missing and null values without removing important records
* Identifying cancellations using **cancellation reason codes (A/B/C/D)**
* Standardizing date and time formats
* Creating derived columns such as delay flags and performance indicators
* Joining multiple tables using airline codes and airport IATA codes

All transformations were performed with a focus on **data integrity and business logic**.

## Analysis Performed
* Delay analysis by route and airport
* Cancellation trend analysis with reason codes
* Airline performance consistency checks
* Peak delay time identification
* Comparison between scheduled vs actual flight times

## Dashboard & Visualizations
An interactive dashboard was created to:
* Track delay and cancellation KPIs
* Visualize route-wise and airport-wise performance
* Enable filtering by airline, airport, and time

The dashboard helps translate raw data into **clear business insights**.

## Key Insights
* Certain routes and airports show consistently higher delays
* Specific cancellation reasons contribute more to operational impact
* Delay patterns vary significantly by time and route

These insights can help airlines improve **planning, resource allocation, and customer experience**.
## Learning Outcome
Through this project, I strengthened my skills in:
* SQL-based data cleaning and joins
* Analytical thinking and problem-solving
* Dashboard design and data storytelling
* Working with real-world, imperfect datasets

## Future Enhancements

* Automating analysis using Python
* Adding predictive delay analysis
* Integrating real-time flight data (API-based)
